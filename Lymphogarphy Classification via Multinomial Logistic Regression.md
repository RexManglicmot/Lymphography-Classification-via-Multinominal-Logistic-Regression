# Lymphograhy Classificatin via Multinominal Logistic Regression

## Continuing Working document

Things still need to do:
* How to run code chunks on Python Markdown
* Flush out intro
* Add more content to the MLR section such as what is it, applications, pros and cons
* Grammar
* Get feedback on work and incorporate


## Introduction
![](https://healthjade.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/lymph-node-infection.jpg)

The lymph nodes are a specialized organ that is responsible for our bodies immune response.

## Loading the Libraries
```python
#load libraries
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
```

## Loading the Data
```python
# load the data from the UCI website into an object
data_source = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/lymphography/lymphography.data"

#store into a panda dataframe
data_orig = pandas.read_csv(data_source)

#show data
print(data_orig)

```

## Cleaning the Data
```

```

## Exploratory Data Analysis
```

```

## Multinominal Logistic Regression
Multinominal Logistic Regression modeling is used a type of supervised learning that is used to classify a dependent variable.
